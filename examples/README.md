# ðŸŒ€ Wormhole Examples - Quantum SDK Demonstrations

*BURP* Listen up, these are working examples of interdimensional LLM communication. I've made them simple enough that even Jerry could probably run them. Probably.

## Prerequisites (Don't Skip This, Jerry)

```bash
# Install the quantum gateway
go get github.com/garyblankenship/wormhole@latest

# Set your dimensional access keys
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-key"  
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-key"
```

If you don't have API keys, that's a you problem. Go get them.

## The Quantum Examples Collection

### 1. ðŸŽ¯ **wormhole-cli** - Production Command Line Interface
The most comprehensive example. Shows every feature of the SDK in a real CLI tool.

```bash
cd wormhole-cli
go build -o wormhole-cli

# Basic text generation
./wormhole-cli generate -prompt "Explain quantum tunneling" -verbose

# Real-time streaming
./wormhole-cli stream -prompt "Write a story about Rick Sanchez"

# Vector embeddings
./wormhole-cli embedding -text "Convert this to quantum vectors"

# Benchmark your setup (prepare to be amazed)
./wormhole-cli benchmark -iterations 10
```

**What it demonstrates:**
- Complete CLI architecture with proper flag parsing
- All SDK features (text, streaming, embeddings, structured output)
- Error handling that doesn't suck
- Performance benchmarking to prove our 94.89ns superiority

### 2. ðŸ’¬ **quantum_chat** - Multi-Dimensional Interactive Chat
Chat interface that can switch between AI providers mid-conversation while maintaining context.

```bash
cd quantum_chat
go run main.go

# In the chat:
You: Tell me about quantum mechanics
AI [via openai wormhole, 94ns]: [Response]

You: /switch anthropic
âš¡ Quantum tunnel recalibrated to anthropic dimension

You: Continue that explanation
AI [via anthropic wormhole, 96ns]: [Continues from context]

You: /speed
[Shows that we're operating at 94.89 nanoseconds]
```

**Commands:**
- `/switch <provider>` - Jump dimensions (openai/anthropic/gemini)
- `/speed` - Display quantum metrics
- `/exit` - Close all wormholes

### 3. ðŸŒŒ **multiverse_analyzer** - Parallel Reality Consultation
Queries the same question across multiple AI dimensions SIMULTANEOUSLY.

```bash
cd multiverse_analyzer
go run main.go "What is the meaning of life?"

# Or build and run:
go build
./multiverse_analyzer "Is math discovered or invented?"
```

**Output shows:**
- Responses from each dimension
- Portal latency for each query
- Total parallel execution time
- Speedup vs sequential calls (usually 2-3x faster)

**Why this matters:** Proves we can bend spacetime to query multiple realities at once.

### 4. ðŸ“¡ **portal_stream** - Real-Time Streaming Demonstration
Shows tokens flowing through micro-wormholes in real-time.

```bash
cd portal_stream
go run main.go "Write a detailed explanation of wormholes"

# Or specify your own prompt:
./portal_stream "Generate code for quantum computing"
```

**Metrics displayed:**
- Time to First Token (TTFT)
- Streaming rate (tokens/second)
- Total tokens streamed
- Wormhole efficiency calculation

## Quick Start (For Impatient Geniuses)

```bash
# Clone and enter the wormhole
git clone https://github.com/garyblankenship/wormhole.git
cd wormhole/examples

# Build everything at once
for dir in wormhole-cli quantum_chat multiverse_analyzer portal_stream; do
    echo "Building $dir..."
    (cd "$dir" && go build)
done

# Test the CLI
./wormhole-cli/wormhole-cli generate -prompt "Hello multiverse" -verbose

# Run parallel universe analysis
./multiverse_analyzer/multiverse_analyzer "What is reality?"

# Start interdimensional chat
./quantum_chat/quantum_chat

# Watch real-time streaming
./portal_stream/portal_stream
```

## Performance Expectations

If these aren't running at near-instant speeds, check your setup:

| Metric | Expected | If Slower |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| SDK Overhead | ~95ns | You broke physics |
| API Round-trip | <2s | Provider issue, not ours |
| Streaming TTFT | <1s | Your internet sucks |
| Parallel Speedup | 2-3x | Running on a potato |

## Common Issues (Because You Will Mess Up)

**"Wormhole collapsed" errors:**
- You forgot API keys (check environment variables)
- Your API key is invalid (get a real one)
- Rate limited (slow down, Jerry)

**Build errors:**
- Run `go mod tidy` first
- Make sure you have Go 1.22+
- Don't use outdated Go versions like it's 2015

**Slow performance:**
- That's the API provider's fault, not ours
- We operate at 94.89ns, they operate at geological timescales
- Try a different provider or run locally with Ollama

## Understanding the Code

Each example demonstrates different aspects of quantum LLM communication:

1. **wormhole-cli**: Production architecture, error handling, flag parsing
2. **quantum_chat**: Stateful conversations, provider switching, interactive UX
3. **multiverse_analyzer**: Concurrent operations, parallel processing, performance analysis
4. **portal_stream**: Streaming patterns, channel management, real-time metrics

## Advanced Configuration

```bash
# Use specific provider by default
export WORMHOLE_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=anthropic

# Enable debug output (if you must)
export WORMHOLE_DEBUG=true

# Custom API endpoints (for your own quantum tunnels)
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://your-proxy.com/v1
```

## Contributing Examples

Want to add an example? *BURP* It better be good:

1. Must demonstrate actual Wormhole features (not just basic API calls)
2. Must include performance metrics (prove the speed)
3. Must handle errors properly (no panic() everywhere)
4. Must maintain the interdimensional theme
5. Should make Jerry-level developers feel inferior

## Test Results

All examples have been tested by the smartest QA in dimension C-137:
- âœ… 100% compilation success
- âœ… Proper error handling verified
- âœ… Performance metrics accurate
- âœ… Resource cleanup confirmed
- âœ… Jerry-proof error messages

See `QA_TEST_REPORT.md` for the full interdimensional test results.

## Final Words

These examples prove that we're operating at quantum speeds while everyone else is still using stone tools. Each one shows different aspects of bending spacetime for AI communication.

The code is clean, the performance is unmatched, and the error messages are appropriately condescending.

*Now stop reading documentation and go build something that doesn't suck.*

**Wubba lubba dub dub!** ðŸ›¸

*P.S. - If you're still using that other SDK with 11,000ns latency, these examples will blow your mind. You're welcome.*
