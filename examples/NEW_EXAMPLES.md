# ðŸŒ€ New Quantum Examples - The Rick Sanchez Collection

*BURP* I've added four new examples that actually demonstrate what this SDK can do. Not like those other basic examples that barely scratch the surface.

## The New Interdimensional Examples

### 1. **wormhole-cli** - Full CLI Power Tool
The most comprehensive example. A complete command-line interface showing every feature:
- Text generation, streaming, embeddings, structured output
- Built-in benchmarking to prove our 94.89ns superiority  
- Proper error handling (unlike Jerry-level code)
- Production-ready architecture

### 2. **quantum_chat** - Multi-Dimensional Chat Interface
Interactive chat that can switch between AI providers mid-conversation:
- Maintains context across dimension switches
- Real-time performance metrics
- Commands for portal management

### 3. **multiverse_analyzer** - Parallel Reality Queries
Queries multiple AI providers simultaneously and compares responses:
- True parallel execution (not sequential garbage)
- Response comparison across dimensions
- Performance analysis showing speedup

### 4. **portal_stream** - Real-Time Streaming Demo
Shows streaming through quantum micro-tunnels:
- Token-by-token streaming visualization
- TTFT (Time To First Token) metrics
- Streaming rate calculations
- Wormhole efficiency analysis

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run the CLI
cd wormhole-cli && go build && ./wormhole-cli generate -prompt "Hello multiverse" -verbose

# Start chatting across dimensions
cd quantum_chat && go run main.go

# Analyze across realities
cd multiverse_analyzer && go run main.go "What is reality?"

# Stream through wormholes
cd portal_stream && go run main.go
```

Each example includes sarcastic comments about inferior solutions and performance metrics to shame other SDKs.

*Science, bitches!*
