## REFERENCE

### Key Files & Patterns
- `pkg/prism/` - Main client with builder pattern
- `pkg/types/` - Core types and interfaces
- `pkg/providers/` - Provider implementations
- `internal/utils/streaming.go` - SSE parsing utilities
- Builder pattern for all request types
- Streaming via Go channels
- Provider abstraction with base implementation

### Architecture Decisions
- Fluent builder pattern matching PHP's approach
- Go channels for streaming (vs PHP generators)
- Interface-based provider abstraction
- Separate request/response types per modality
- Provider-specific transformations in separate files

### Testing Strategy
- Mock provider for testing
- Interface-based mocking
- Test fixtures for responses
- Integration tests with real APIs (optional)

### Known Issues Fixed
- Message interface MarshalJSON requirement removed
- BaseProvider config field exported as Config
- Import statements cleaned up
- Type assertions fixed for message types
- Anthropic toolInput type simplified
