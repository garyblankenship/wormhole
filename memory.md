## REFERENCE

### Key Files & Patterns
- `pkg/wormhole/` - Main client with quantum builder pattern
- `pkg/types/` - Core types and interfaces
- `pkg/providers/` - Provider implementations
- `internal/utils/streaming.go` - SSE parsing utilities
- Builder pattern for all request types
- Streaming via Go channels
- Provider abstraction with base implementation

### Architecture Decisions
- Fluent builder pattern matching PHP's approach
- Go channels for streaming (vs PHP generators)
- Interface-based provider abstraction
- Separate request/response types per modality
- Provider-specific transformations in separate files
