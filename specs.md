# Intelligent Memory Management System Specification

## Executive Summary

**Purpose**: Transform Claude Code from a stateless assistant into a persistent, learning development partner through automated memory management using native hooks and subagents.

**Scope**: Complete replacement of passive memory MCP with proactive, intelligent memory system that automatically captures, organizes, and applies development context without manual intervention.

**Success Metrics**:
- Zero manual memory management required
- Context automatically available at session start
- User preferences remembered and applied consistently
- Architectural decisions preserved across sessions
- 90% reduction in context re-explanation time

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Automatic Memory Extraction
**Description**: System automatically identifies and captures meaningful development insights from conversations and tool usage.

**User Story**: As a developer, I want my coding preferences and project decisions automatically remembered so I don't have to re-explain my patterns every session.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] System triggers after significant tool usage (Edit, Write, MultiEdit, Bash)
- [x] Extracts user preferences (error handling patterns, build processes, coding style)
- [x] Captures architectural decisions with rationale
- [x] Records bug patterns and solutions
- [x] Identifies performance optimizations and trade-offs

**Edge Cases**:
- Scenario: Tool used but no meaningful insight → Response: No extraction triggered
- Scenario: Conflicting preferences detected → Response: Latest preference takes precedence with note
- Scenario: Memory file becomes too large (>50KB) → Response: Archive old sections automatically

### 2. Proactive Context Injection
**Description**: System automatically provides relevant context at session start based on current working directory and project state.

**User Story**: As a developer, I want Claude to immediately understand my project context when I start a new session so I can continue work seamlessly.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Detects project type (Go, PHP, JS, Python, Rust)
- [x] Analyzes recent file modifications
- [x] Searches memory for relevant context
- [x] Injects 3-5 most pertinent insights
- [x] Provides current active work items and known issues

### 3. Smart Memory Organization
**Description**: System maintains well-structured, searchable memory format with automatic categorization and cleanup.

**User Story**: As a developer, I want my project memory to stay organized and current so information remains easily findable and actionable.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Uses structured markdown format with standardized sections
- [x] Maintains active context separate from historical data
- [x] Updates timestamps and version information automatically
- [x] Consolidates duplicate information
- [x] Archives outdated information appropriately

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture Constraints
- **Platform**: Claude Code native hooks and subagents system
- **Language**: Python 3.8+ for hooks, Markdown for subagents
- **Dependencies**: Standard library only for hooks
- **Storage**: Local `.claude/` directory structure

### Performance Requirements
- **Hook Execution**: < 100ms for decision making
- **Memory Extraction**: < 5 seconds per significant interaction
- **Context Injection**: < 3 seconds at session start
- **Memory Search**: < 1 second for keyword queries

### Reliability Requirements
- **Hook Failure**: System continues if individual hooks fail
- **Memory Corruption**: Automatic backup and recovery
- **Large Files**: Handle memory files up to 1MB efficiently

### Hook Communication Protocol

**Hook Input (stdin)**:
```json
{
  "tool_name": "string",
  "output": "string", 
  "prompt": "string",
  "session_id": "string"
}
```

**Hook Output (stdout)**:
```json
{
  "continue": true,
  "message": "string (optional)",
  "invoke_task": {
    "description": "string",
    "subagent_type": "string",
    "prompt": "string"
  }
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (2-3 hours)
- [x] Create `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/hooks/` directories
- [x] Implement memory-extractor subagent with structured output
- [x] Implement memory-injector subagent with context analysis
- [x] Create post-tool-completion hook with intelligence triggers
- [x] Create session-start hook with project detection
- [x] Test basic automation with simple code changes

**Deliverable**: Working automatic memory extraction and injection

### Phase 2: Intelligence Enhancement (1-2 hours)
- [x] Add user-prompt-submit hook for context-aware assistance
- [x] Implement smart triggers based on error patterns and architectural decisions
- [x] Add memory search capabilities for manual queries
- [x] Create memory maintenance automation
- [x] Implement backup and recovery mechanisms

- [ ] Integration with external knowledge sources
- [ ] Advanced search with semantic understanding
- [ ] Memory analytics and insights

**Deliverable**: Production-ready intelligent memory system

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests (Manual Validation)**:
- Hook execution: Verify hooks trigger on appropriate events
- Memory extraction: Confirm meaningful insights are captured
- Context injection: Validate relevant context is provided
- File integrity: Ensure memory.md maintains proper structure

**Integration Tests**:
- End-to-end flow: New project setup → work session → memory capture → new session → context injection
- Error handling: Verify system continues working when hooks fail
- Performance: Confirm response times meet requirements under various loads

**User Acceptance Tests**:
- Developer workflow: Can work on project without re-explaining context
- Preference persistence: Coding style consistently applied across sessions
- Decision recall: Architectural choices remembered and referenced appropriately

## Risk Assessment & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Hook execution failures | Medium | Medium | Error handling + graceful degradation |
| Memory file corruption | Low | High | Automatic backups + validation checks |
| Performance degradation | Low | Medium | Lazy loading + memory file size limits |
| Context overload | Medium | Low | Smart filtering + relevance scoring |
| Privacy concerns | Low | High | Local storage only + clear data ownership |

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Usability
- Zero configuration required for basic functionality
- Clear feedback when memory operations occur
- Intuitive memory file structure for manual reading/editing

### Maintainability
- Well-documented hook and subagent code
- Modular design allowing individual component updates
- Clear error messages and debugging information

### Security
- No external network communication
- Local file system access only within project boundaries
- User data remains completely private and local

## Success Definition

1. Developers stop needing to re-explain their preferences and context
2. Claude Code feels like a continuous, learning development partner
3. Project knowledge persists and evolves naturally over time
4. Context switches become seamless and productive
5. The memory system operates invisibly without user intervention

This specification transforms Claude Code from a helpful but forgetful assistant into a true AI development partner with persistent project intelligence.
